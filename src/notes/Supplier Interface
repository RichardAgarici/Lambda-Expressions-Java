  The Supplier Interface:


    public static void show() {
        Supplier<Double> getRandom = () -> Math.random();
        var random = getRandom.get();
        System.out.println(random);
    }


/*
.get()
      The supplier lambda won't be executed if we don't use the .get() method.
      This class also has certain Supplier forms just like Consumers.
      DoubleSupplier, IntSupplier... ( This again supports the idea of autoboxing)
